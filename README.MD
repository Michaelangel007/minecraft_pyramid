# Minecraft Pyramid

The running gag with any serious Minecraft player is that they have 17+ projects being worked on simultaneously.

Well, I can finally scratch one off my Minecraft Bucket List:

* [x] Build a Big-Ass Pyramid a.k.a. _"Engineering R Us"_ a.k.a. "This can't good for my carpal tunnel."

This normal looking pyramid by day ...

... has a secret lurking by night:

I designed and wired up the two circuits which took about an hour.

Joking aside, it is located in our desert mining operation. Here is the view from night when you first enter through the portal.

The pryamid is off to the right in the distance:

Moving along the path here is the view from the SE corner looking east from the portal entrace and north towards the east entrance:

When we get to the east entrance here is the view at night looking south:

* ![night_east_side_facing_south_outside.png](night_east_side_facing_south_outside.png)

And looking up the east facing side with the "glowing" stairs.  I used "back-lighting" by placing torches on the inside which lights them up the path at night.

Inside the pryamid here is what the east facing looks like when use Optifine's + a custom shader:

One of the problems with any "big build" is lighting. Initially I wasn't going to have any glass blocks but
after realzing that the ceiling blocks all the light having torches on the ground just doesn't look all that great.
I decided to rip most of the East facing side and replace it with glass, stairs, and Jack O' Lanterns.

Here is the morning view looking out the East side.

In hindsight I probably should of built more out of glass considering I'm in the middle of the desert with tons of sand I can smelt into glass.

I mentioned two circuits.  The first circuit on a night sensor that turns on the Creeper lighting on the West side.
he second circuit is also on a night sensor on the North side.  The stairs are on a delayed timing circuit that
makes the turn on in increments as they slowly turn on going up the pryamid.

The view from the top shows our 48 furnace "super smelter" beyond the main portal entrace.

As you can tell I "splurged" and made the pryamid cap entirely out of gold blocks.  When you are rich there is nothing else to spend them on so why not?


This 153 x 153 x 77 tall pyramid took about a week to build.

It's kind of funny Phantoms spawn inside. =P

Here the north facing side is done before I decided what to do with the air gap.

This shot is from the SE corner.

I decided to go with a yellow glass theme.

Now to finish that Cactus XP farm inside ... :-)
